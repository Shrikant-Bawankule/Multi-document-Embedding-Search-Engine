yes, its possible... in fact, theres some gl widget code in usrlppgl somewhere... its named glib.c my ibms down right now though, so i cant find the exact location  warning this code feels quite bogus. it does things like calling noport before winopen, and then extracting an x window id from it anyway. it worked just fine under aix 3.1 i spent last weekend trying to port it to 3.2 gl under 3.2 doesnt seem to like it, and its turning into a hard job. check out your info pages it has some pretty good documentation on whan you can and cant do when mixing gl and x, and how to go about doing so.
