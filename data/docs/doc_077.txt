i dont think the question is will os2 x.x run windows y.y apps now? a more important question is will subsequent os2 versions continue to run apps from subsequent windows versions in the future? can it keep up? will a future os2 3.0 run windows 4 apps? ole2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come. after this fall, i believe ibm no longer has any rights to view microsoft code. after that, the only way to maintain some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer. would you want to reverse-engineer an ole2 application?
