youre blowing smoke. qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas markets like japan and the ec. the government told them dont do encryption if you ever hope to export this technology. the reason that cdma doesnt have encryption is not because the g-men came aknocking at qualcomms door. its because qualcomm doesnt think that the us market for digital cellular is big enough for them. this is just the international traffic in arms regulations all over again. if you dont believe me, call qualcomm and ask them. dont just throw out conspicracy theories. at least, dont do it on sci.crypt--there are whole other newsgroups devoted to this kind of uninformed claptrap. hah. theyre not that much more expensive. besides, if a drug dealer can afford a rolex and a mercedes, he can darn well afford cylink phones. no, cylink sells their phones because theyre willing to make different stuff for domestic use vs. export. qualcomm isnt. so cylink makes money--thats capitalism, comrade. someone this and someone that. if you think its so easy, why are you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it? your name would become known and loved by dozens! but no, that would require actual effort.
