stuff deleted ok, heres the solution to your problem. move to canada. yesterday i was able to watch four games...the nj-pitt at 100 on abc, la-cal at 300 cbc, buff-bos at 700 tsn and fox, and mon-que at 730 cbc. i think that if each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights i havent counted so thats a pure guess. i have two tvs in my house, and i set them up side-by-side to watch mon-que and keep an eye on bos-buff at the same time. i did the same for the two afternoon games. btw, those abc commentaters were great! i was quite impressed they seemed to know that their audience wasnt likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job. they were quite impartial also, imo.
