feel free to patronize me all you like i need the tips. - seriously, if you were insulted, i apologize. people are sucking up to the government when they decide that only the things the government says are plausible. especially if they refuse to consider reasonable alternatives. however, from what i saw plastered all over the tv news last night, its no longer necessary to be an independent thinker to depart from the governments party line. it looks like our independent press may actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance. this, to me, is a good sign. i hope it continues. independent thinkers question authority. in a situation where only one set of facts are being presented, coming to a conclusion is not the hallmark of an independent thinker unless its coupled with the ability to challenge those facts critically. the scientific method consists of more than choosing the popular hypothesis its even more than choosing between two hypotheses that other people have proposed. --
