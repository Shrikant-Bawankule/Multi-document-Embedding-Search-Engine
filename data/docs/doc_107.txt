jobs? what the hell have jobs to do with it? its another touchy-feely program from the new, vapid administration. the fact is, the major claim made for universal immunization -- that all children will be immunized -- has absolutely no validity. several states already have u.i. programs, have had these programs for _years_. the result on average, their success rates are no better than the national average. it seems that the gummint hasnt yet figured out a way to make parents bring their kids in. yet another case of shameless demagoguery from the new democrats, the agents of change. what? clinton using this issue for _partisan gain_? do tell. all together now... cmon, you know the words... meet the new boss! same as the old boss! and the chorus we wont get fooled again! ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ paul havemann internet paulhsh.com
