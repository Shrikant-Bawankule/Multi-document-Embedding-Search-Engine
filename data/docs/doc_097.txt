hey man! - having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a couple of sessions of mock hockey, im ready to invest in hockey equipment particularly since i will be taking summer hockey lessons. however, i am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment. ive checked out local stores and looked at catalogs, but i was hoping to solicit opinionssuggestions before actually plunking down any money. having played football in high school and college i at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison. but for example what are the advantagesdisadvantages to different kinds of shoulder pads and pantsgirdles? are there any notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles? etc. so any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.
