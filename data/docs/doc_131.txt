application comp indeed, of and well, i thought that highmem.sys would do that too. i just took out emm386 of my config.sys, and im still loading my other drivers high mouse, vga shadow bios, dos-key etc. i havent checked memc, but i believe i have managed to load them high ie between 640kb and 1024kb. also, ever since i took out emm386, windows loads slightly faster, i get about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows im running 386 enhanced with 4 meg ram, 7 meg swap and i got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl-alt-del after exiting windows. i would really like to keep emm386 out of my config.sys. anybody else have info on this???
