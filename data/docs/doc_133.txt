we are trying to install a donated hard disk miniscribe vintage 1988 on a supercheap ancient compaq xt for use in education. the only problem is that the supercheap compaq didnt come with the manual and i havent been able to figure out how to start the setup program. i began using pcs after 286s were invented, so i have a couple of basic questions 1. did xt-class computers even have setup programs? 2. if they did or, do, how do i access it? if anybody has any good advice on how to proceed or what to do next or what to look out for, please let me know. e-mail is best, but ill also be watching the newsgroup postings. thanks in advance, -robert --
