when trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1, you need a trimmer or to screen devices, it cant be made from adding 2 resitors of 1 value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the error of 1 to cope with. you have 3 choices a live with the error of 1 tolerance devices for low q circuits or low sensitivity designs b buy resistors with better than 1 tolerance vishaydale c use trimmers or sots select-on-test
