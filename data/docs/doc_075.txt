phil didnt one of the early jet fighters have these? i also think phil the germans did some work on these in wwii. the naca came up with them before world war ii. nasa is directly descended from the naca, with space added in. youll notice that i didnt mention sweep wings even though the x-5, tested at whats now dryden, had them. we did steal that one dirctly from the germans. the difference is that swept wings dont change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do. perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion? 747s have swept wings, f-111s have sweep wings. phil a lot of this was also done by the military... after nasa aerodynamicists proposed them and nasa test teams demonstrated them. richard whitcomb and r.t. jones, at langley research center, were giants in the field. dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling in the 70s and 50s, respectively. its true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds kc-135 and yf-102 but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement. the yf-102 was completely ours and the kc-135 was bailed to us. the air force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts. dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. no mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. general dynamics decided to make the f-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were. mind you, the avro arrow and the x-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog. phil egad! im disagreeing with mary shafer! the nasa habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing. on the other hand, all those second-hand navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings--something most pilots at edwards air force base cant do.
