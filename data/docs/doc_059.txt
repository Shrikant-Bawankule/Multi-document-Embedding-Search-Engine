a word of warning, though kryptonite also sells almost useless cable locks under the kryptonite name. when i obtained my second motorcycle, i migrated one of my kryptonite u-locks from my bicycle to the new bike. i then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle. for about the same money 20 i had the choice of a kryptonite cable lock advantages lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, kryptonite name or a cheesy no-name u-lock advantages real steel. i chose the kryptonite cable. after less than a week, i took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name u-lock. first, the krypto cable i bought is not made by kryptonite, is not covered by the kryptonite guarantee, and doesnt even approach kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance. it is just some generic made-in-taiwan cable lock with the kryptonite name on it. secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke. i dont know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when i went to unlock it. thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark. i didnt try it obviously, but i have my doubts that the lock mechanism would stand up to an insert screwdriver and torque attack. fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to deter theft for my piece of crap bicycle, that is. all cables suffer the weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time. if you are patient you can cut cables with fingernail clippers. aviation snips would go through the cable in well under a minute. --
