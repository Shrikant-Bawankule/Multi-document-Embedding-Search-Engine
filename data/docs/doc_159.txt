deletions geez, dal must have slipped something into teds drink sometime. comparing prince to pagnozzi offensively is laughable. prince has never hit well in the minors and hes now 27 years old, i think. pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors. ill bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming i dont have another brain cramp and forget. he had a very good year at louisville before coming up to the majors. as i recall, the hype on pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding. when he got to the majors and didnt hit as well as expected not as much playing time?, he became exhibit 312 in nichols law of catcher defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher. its not clear he ever learned to hit. his four years with more than 100 ab-- born 31 july 1962 year ab ba slg oba 1988 195 .282 .320 .328 1990 220 .277 .373 .321 1991 459 .264 .351 .317 1992 485 .249 .359 .290 no power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, now declining. if ted is going to invoke pagnozzi as a model for prince, given that prince has underperformed pagnozzi in the minors, its not a rosy picture. btw, im still unhappy with moving zeile, who had the same reputation coming up in the cardinal organization as pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average or below average fielding catcher. harold
