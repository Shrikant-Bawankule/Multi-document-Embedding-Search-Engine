in the following report _turkey eyes regional role_ ankara, turkey ap april 27, 1993, we find in the last paragraph turanist although premier suleyman demirel criticized ozals often turanist brash calls for more turkish influence, he also has spoken turanist of a swath of turkic peoples stretching from the adriatic turanist sea to the great wall of china. who does demirel think he is fooling? it seems at both ends of his envisioned pan-turkic empire -- the balkans and the caucasus -- turkeys fascist boasts are being pre-empted. i would suggest turkey let the world feel some of their grey wolf teeth, and attempt to stretch from the adriatic to china! turkey will have cried wolf just once too much!
