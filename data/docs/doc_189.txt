my understanding is that the expected errors are basically known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked that dont have the right values in yet because they arent set till after launch, and suchlike. rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it. good grief. and i thought the shuttle software was known for being well-engineered. if this is actually the case, every member of the programming team should be taken out and shot. given that ive heard the shuttle software rated as level 5 in maturity, i strongly doubt that this is the case.
