my rule of thumb is dont give rides to people that wear a bigger helmet than you, unless your taste runs that way, or they are family.friends. gee, reminds me of a dancer in hull, just over the river from ottowa, that i saw a few years ago, for her i would a bought a bigger helmet or even her own bike or anything else she wanted -
