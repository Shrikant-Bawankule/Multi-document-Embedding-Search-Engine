sorry, thats a feature. the icccm specifies how the app should set its title, so the wm is obliged to do it. if this bothers you, complain to the app writer. write your own wm that doesnt support the icccm. or write an program that you give a window id and a title. the your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it, your program switches it back again.
