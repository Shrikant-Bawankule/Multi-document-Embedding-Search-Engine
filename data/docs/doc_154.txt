sure about that? maybe proxima might cause problems, but at oort cloud distances ac a and ac b together look like a point source. besides, even the solar systems oort cloud is unstable over geologic time, right, and needs to be replentished from somewhere else, like the short period comets of the kupier belt? or maybe im misremembering something i read or heard somewhere... until were able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars to detect planets, we wont know enough to say whether or not a single star has planets. and were likely to find out about the close ones first. heck, if neutron stars can have planets, anything can have planets. or was that discovery disconfirmed?
