i dont know the exact coverage in the states. in canada it is covered by tsn, so maybe espn will grab their coverage! i dont know! as for the picks ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that alexander daigle will go 1. hell either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec. imo i would take kariya. he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships. daigle didnt show this for his junior team. san jose will then get kariya. tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov i think thats it or a defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong because of expansion i wont go further but i will name other of the blue chip prospects - chris gratton - chris pridham - a swedish player who i cant remember his name draft order ----------- 1 ottawa 2 san jose 3 tampa bay 4 south florida or anahiem 5 south florida or anahiem 6 hartford 7 edmonton 8 dallas 9 ny rangers 10 philadelphia the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - i dont have the standings here and am guessing in my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with kariya leading the way but not going 1
