ide also uses dma techniques. i believe floppy controller also uses dma, and most ad boards also use dma. dma is no big deal, and has nothing to do directly with scsi. you can thank your software for that. if dos had a few more brains, it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else. the hardware will support it, but dos at least wont. again, this has nothing to do with scsi. and if you stick with dos youll wonder why you cant multitask.
