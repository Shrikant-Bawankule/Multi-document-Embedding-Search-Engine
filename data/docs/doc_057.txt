how about some numbers here? some kind of benchmark? if you want, let me start it - 486dx2-66 - 32 specint92, 16 specfp92 . numbers? pentium 66mhz - 65 specint92, 57 specfp92 . powerpc 66mhz - 50 specint92, 80 specfp92 . note this is the 601 alpha 150mhz - 74 specint92,126 specfp92 - just for comparison not in a clock-doubled system. there isnt a doubling in performance, but it _is_ quite significant. maybe about a 70 increase in performance. besides, for 0 wait state performance, youd need a cache anyway. i mean, who uses a processor that runs at the speed of 80ns simms? note that this memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 12.5 mhz. numbers? -- ravikumar venkateswar rvenkateuiuc.edu
