a out of context must have missed when you said this about these other promises of god that we keep getting subjected to. could you please explain why i am wrong and they are ok? or an acknowledgement of public hypocrisy. both or neither.  so, according to you, jim, the only way to criticize one person for taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a response to every person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context? did i either ask or assert that? or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again? btw to david josli im still waiting for either your public acknowledgement of your telepathy and precognition are you a witch? or an appology and retraction.  can you wait without whining? to pass the time, maybe you should go back and read the portions of my article that you so conveniently deleted in your reply. youll find most of your answers there. nope in particular example of telepathy? what threat. produce it. more telepathy? or maybe just empathic telepathy, capable of determining emotional states. more telepathy. how do you know trying?!?!? precognition? substantiate.
