just a thought on resources, it is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources. i have used glockenspeil commonview under motif and os2. i wrote a resource converter from os2 to motif, but it really wasnt too easy, especially the naming scheme. in motif you cannot rename controlswidgets. with windows you can call the ok button id_ok in every instance, this doesnt work for motif, youd have to call it dialog1_ok, and motif expects a text string rather than a number. so your constructor should know how to convert a define into the proper resource identifier. id check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to.  by the way, i would never use commonview or glockenspiel for anything  alex.
