......... i, some years ago, almost became a victim of this. squirted a fair amount in an old model 15 teletype which was acting up, then turned it on. the eruption when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular... i almost got my eyebrows singed, the plastic old ones had safety glass cover over the platen, etc flew across the room, and several people in the room almost had heart attacks. beware the explosive properties of wd40 vapor.
