back in high school i worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental psychologists at bell labs. when they were doing visual perception and memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond refresh rates common. so your case of 1200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either. steve
