this was reported in canadian papers thursday, 22 april - i _think_ the source was upi, but dont recall for certain. i understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered, so we may learn more during their hearings. tough call without more investigation, but if the thermal imaging story holds up, i think the government will be more credable... of course, paranoia fans wont believe their results anyway, will they? hear, hear! id also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports that multiple victims were found shot in the head, and in positions inconsistent with fire victims. it is simply too early to draw conclusions either way about this nasty incident, but i tend to believe the government side.
