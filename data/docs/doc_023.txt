ive only ever done it in an automatic. i was sitting in my olds, in the winter, at a light, when i heard screeching behind me. i managed to dart into the left turn lane before the sliding jetta wound up half where i was and half in the parked car beside where i was. ive never had occasion to do it on a bike, but i imagine that it would be even easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. giving a gander at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the screeching.
