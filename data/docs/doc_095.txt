discussing the use of irq 7 to put it a little differently - irq 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. - dos doesnt monitor irq 7 it uses other means to determine when its time to send out another byte to the printer. - most all? hardware printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of irq 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between the isa pin and the associated driver. other adapters control the irq line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode. - unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers i.e., either assert high or assert low for the irq lines rather than tristate drivers assert high, assert low, or dont assert anything. the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper. incidentally, note that theres no requirement that a card hold the irq line low when no interrupt is desired. if that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines, and that certainly isnt a requirement. - non-dos operating systems os2, nt ?, various unices or whatever the proper plural of unix might be require the use of irq 7 for performance reasons. and the sb16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.
