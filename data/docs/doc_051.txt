any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? they arent really at the same point along the suv spectrum - not to mention price range. how about the explorer, trooper, blazer, montero, and if the budget allows, the land cruiser? bear in mind that 90 of all suvs purchased never venture off-road. carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance when choosing one, and realistically decide whether youll actually make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice some of the on-road comfort. john
