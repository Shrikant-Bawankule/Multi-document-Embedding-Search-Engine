dont worry about this -- theyll drop you like a hot potato after you do make a claim. theyll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end when they leave you in the lurch. more than that. geico funded the company that developed lidar. when locals showed a reluctance to buy the units, geico started giving them away. i know theyve given units to the florida highway patrol, county sheriffs a and some local governments. the real question is why? this is the hook. geico, and other ins. co.s can tell which drivers represent risk. this is a determination they can make after you receive a speeding ticket from one of geicos lidar units. most drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but this gives them the opportunity to raise rates for equal risk. its called extra profits. they also know how silly the nsl is, and how it is almost universally ignored. driving in excess of the nsl gets you a ticket, an increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesnt make you a riskier driver to insure. like the sound of this? like the people who thought up the scheme? go geico!
