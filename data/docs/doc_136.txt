society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! the basic reason is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is no big deal. kids see hundreds on murderous acts on tv, we can abort children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. so why be surprised when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. they dont care because the message they hear is life is cheap!
