secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life, islam places the rights of society and every member in it above the rights of the individual, this is what i call true human rights. as a muslim living in a non-muslim land i am bound by the laws of the land i live in, but i do not disregard islamic law it still remains a part of my life. if the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that i am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then i must leave the land. so in a way islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too. in an islamic state one ruled by a khaliphate religions other than islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they dont affect the genral population and dont come into direct conflict with state laws, dhimmis non-muslim population are exempt from most islamic laws on religion, such as fighting in a jihad, giving zakat alms giving etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as military protection and if they are poor they will receive zakat. after the fatwa didnt rushdie re-affirm his faith in islam, didnt he go thru a very public conversion to islam? if so he is binding himself to islamic laws. he has to publicly renounce in his belief in islam so the burden is on him. mas
