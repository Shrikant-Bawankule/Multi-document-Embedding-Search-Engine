not bad. we had a similar situation. slowpitch softball, bases loaded, weakest hitter at the plate. he hits a line drive over the third basemans head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in foul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field. but the umpire called fair ball! i was coaching third, yelling at evrybody to move up a base. the umps position it was still fair when it passed third base. why the other team didnt immediately protest ill never know we certainly werent going to argue about it, since every body did manage to advance one base safely. there was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my runner from second base leg, fielded by the ss, steps on second to force the runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire called a triple play protest removed when we won the game anyway.
