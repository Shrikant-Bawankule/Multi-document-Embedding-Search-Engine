oh dear, time for me to try to remember my chemistry. lets see if i can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind. ha! i knew there was a double bond! now how shall i show that in ascii? mek acetone c - c - c - c c - c - c   o o the hydrogens are not shown, and  represents double bond. mek has a methyl ch3 on one side, and an ethyl c2h5 on the other. acetone has two methyls. so acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead is dimethyl ketone. both solvents have similar properties. i think that mek may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe. its a lot harder to buy mek than it once was. use acetone. nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone. if you buy some for your workshop, get the very cheapest, because the more expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you dont need.
