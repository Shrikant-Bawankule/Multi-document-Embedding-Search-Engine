i dont have nor imagine nor real 3d, but as old amiga user i think you should take a look also to real 3d 2.0 for the amiga. i saw imagine 2.0 on the amiga for a long time at my friends home, and ive seen r3d 2.0 in action at bit.movie 93 in riccione, italy an italian computer graphics contest. many professionals using 3d studio on pc, softimage for silicon graphics and imagine on the amiga were very impressed by the power of this programs. sorry, ive lost the posting with full description of features of this great program. for more informations give a look in comp.sys.amiga.graphics. representative of activa international told me that it will be out in 2 weeks for the amiga and that pc ms-windows, silicon indigo and unix version are under development. ciao, sergio
