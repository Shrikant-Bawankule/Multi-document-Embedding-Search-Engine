sorry, but olwm and tvtwm dont do it. they place the title at that position and the window at a position below it. this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is later. currently, my solution is xcreatewindow... xsetwmproperties.. xmapwindow... xflush... xmovewindow... it works with olwm, but is less than elegant. all this leaves me wondering if im overlooking something obvious.
