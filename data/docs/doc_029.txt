. . . i am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable. the concepts of right and wrong or correctincorrect or truefalse belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions. it makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good or better than another position. let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics perception and motivation, respectively. one can certainly ask if a percept is right correct, true, veridical or wrong incorrect, false, illusory. but it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false. on the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives. therefore, your suggested answers a-c simply cant be considered they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment. now the problem with d is that it is double-barrelled i agree with the first part that the rightness of a moral position is a meaningless question, for the reasons stated above. but that is irrelevant to the alleged implication not an implication at all that one cannot feel peace is better than war. i certainly can make value judgments bad, better, best without asserting the correctness of the position. sorry for the lengthy dismissal of a-d. my short e answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right correct or wrong incorrect. they simply hold different moral values feelings.
