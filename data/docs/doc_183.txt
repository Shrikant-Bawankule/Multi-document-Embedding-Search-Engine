tonigth a tv journal here in brasil announced that an object, beyond plutos orbit, was found by an observatory at hawaii. they named the object karla. the program said the object wasnt a gaseous giant planet, and should be composed by rocks and ices. can someone confirm these information? could this object be a new planet or a kuiper object? thanks in advance. francisco.
