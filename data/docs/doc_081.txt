who cares about typos of these meaningless, synthetic names? if the cars were named after a person, e.g. honda, id be more respectful. wrong! the gs300 and sc300 use straight sixes, while the es300 uses a v6. only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a v6 and inline 6 in its lineup, but that wont last for long.
