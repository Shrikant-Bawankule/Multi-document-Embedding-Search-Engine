or he was just convinced by religious fantasies of the time that he was the messiah, or he was just some rebel leader that an organisation of jews built into godhood for the purpose off throwing of the yoke of roman oppression, or....... are the moslem fanatics who strap bombs to their backs and driving into jewish embassies dying for the truth hint they think they are? were the nazi soldiers in wwii dying for the truth? people die for lies all the time. was hitler a liar? how about napoleon, mussolini, ronald reagan? we spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? so the answer is no, they wouldnt be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things. why do you think he healed people, because the bible says so? but if god doesnt exist the other possibility then the bible is not divinely inspired and one cant use it as a piece of evidence, as it was written by unbiased observers. were hitler or mussolini lunatics? how about genghis khan, jim jones... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics. so we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad. possibly self-fulfilling prophecy ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies, possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such riddles like nostradamus that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional prophecy. stuff about how hard it is to be a christian deleted i severely recommend you reconsider the reasons you are a christian, they are very unconvincing to an unbiased observer.
